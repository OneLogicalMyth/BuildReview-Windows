			<Title>Microsoft Windows Domain Hosts Cache Domain Credentials Locally</Title>			
			<Details>The system was found to cache domain authentication credentials for the last &lt;code&gt;{{VALUE}}&lt;/code&gt;.</Details>
			<Description>By default, Windows stores the credentials, username and password hash, of the last 10 people that have logged into a Windows computer. This is a feature, known as cached credential storage, that allows users to authenticate even if Active Directory (AD) is unavailable. However, these cached credentials can be used to attack accounts that have authenticated in the past. An administrator, or attacker with administrator or system privileges, could extract the cached credentials and crack the passwords for other accounts that have logged-on to the machine. This is particularly useful to an attacker that has gained control of a machine in a Domain environment, where a Domain Admin has previously logged-on to the machine with their current password. Cracking the Domain Admin's password would lead to a full Domain compromise in this instance. Cracking the passwords for less-privileged accounts could also be useful for impersonating them and gaining access to other machines that also cache passwords.</Description>
			<LongRecommendation>It is recommended that four or fewer domain user authentication credentials are cached. This can be accomplished by modifying the following security policy setting &lt;b&gt;Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options / Interactive Logon: Number of Previous Logons to Cache&lt;/b&gt; and setting the value to 0 Logons.</LongRecommendation>

			<TableTitle>Administrative Templates</TableTitle>
			<Description>Administrative templates supplement security options with additional hardening configuration, they can also be used to configure additional options to meet the organisation's needs such as folder redirection for example. Administrative templates are particularly recommended when direct registry settings are commonly used within the environment for hardening. Since it is only necessary to define an administrative template once and then allow for distribution via Group Policy. Among other things, this ensures that the registry settings are actually implemented on all target computers in a replicated manner. This allows for essential security configuration to quickly deploy in a manner that is identical from system to system, thus reducing the management overhead in maintaining best practices. Incorrect configuration of an administrative template could lead to security risks and present opportunities for an illicit individual, thus it is essential the policies are regularly reviewed and updated.</Description>

			<Title>Server Message Block Version 1 Enabled</Title>			<TableTitle>SMBv1 Configuration</TableTitle>
			
			<Description>Microsoft and others are advising that customers should consider blocking legacy protocols on their networks in particular SMBv1 as an additional defense-in-depth strategy to further protect against attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Disabling SMBv1 could cause a range of software and other services that depend on SMB to stop functioning correctly, so it is recommended to check with vendors and test first before disabling it.&lt;br /&gt;A client that uses SMBv1 is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack which could see your client ignore all the enhanced features of a higher protocol version. This is performed by answering the requests for a particular host but blocking the use of SMBv2 or higher, thus ensuring that only SMBv1 is used during the attack. The client will unwillingly connect using the SMBv1 protocol and share credentials with the rogue server; unless encryption was required on that share to prevent SMBv1.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it is worth noting that SMBv1 is over 30 years old and potentially has many unidentified issues that could cause harm or disruption to the host.</Description>
			<LongRecommendation>Ensure SMBv1 is disabled this can be achieved by issuing the following commands and then restarting the host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Server Configuration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an administrative PowerShell window issue the following command:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ -Name SMB1 -Type DWORD -Value 0 -Force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Configuration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an administrative PowerShell window issue the following command:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\mrxsmb10\ -Name Start -PropertyType DWORD -Value 4 -Force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\ -Name DependOnService -Type MultiString -Value 'Bowser','MRxSmb20','NSI' -Force&lt;/code&gt;</LongRecommendation>

			<TableTitle>LLMNR and NBT-NS Poisoning</TableTitle>
			<Description>Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are two components of Microsoft Windows machines. LLMNR was introduced in Windows Vista and is the successor to NBT-NS. It allows machines on the same subnet to identify hosts when DNS fails, a broadcast to other machines on the same local network is made instead, the correct address is then received via LLMNR or NBT-NS.  A malicious host on the same network can intercept requests for LLMNR and NBT-NS, allowing for a poisoned address to be returned. A handshake is initiated between the two hosts, which includes the NTLM hash, the hash is then captured and taken offline for decryption.</Description>
			<LongRecommendation>&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you have disabled LLMNR and NBT-NS on Windows hosts. Also ensure that the administrative passwords are changed to meet a complexity requirements and are greater than 14 characters. Additionally, these should not be based on a dictionary word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disable LLMNR for Windows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch &lt;i&gt;Group Policy Editor&lt;/i&gt; this can be local or a group policy for the domain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navgate to &lt;i&gt;Local Computer Policy -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Network -&gt; DNS Client&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;DNS Client&lt;/i&gt; double click on the &lt;i&gt;Turn Off Multicast Name Resolution&lt;/i&gt; ensure it set to &lt;i&gt;Enabled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also disable this via the registry, add a DWORD named &lt;i&gt;EnableMulticast&lt;/i&gt; with a value of 0 to the following key location &lt;i&gt;HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disable NetBIOS Name Service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the run command enter &lt;i&gt;ncpa.cpl&lt;/i&gt; and click &lt;i&gt;OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;i&gt;Local area connection&lt;/i&gt; and then click on &lt;i&gt;Properties&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double-click on &lt;i&gt;Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)&lt;/i&gt;, click &lt;i&gt;Advanced &lt;/i&gt;then click on the &lt;i&gt;WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)&lt;/i&gt; tab&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;i&gt;Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</LongRecommendation>

			<Title>Windows Host Patch Levels are not Current</Title>			
			<TableTitle>Missing Microsoft Patches</TableTitle>
			<Description>The target system was discovered not to have all the relevant patches applied. It is important to maintain patch status because often patches counter vulnerabilities that are exploited in the wild. As is common for major software products, numerous vulnerabilities have been identified in Microsoft Windows operating systems over the years, many of which can be exploited to allow an attacker to gain control of a target system. Microsoft releases vendor security patches, as well as functional fixes on a monthly basis to address issues found. Occasionally, patches are released for particularly significant vulnerabilities outside the monthly "patch Tuesday" releases. Also less frequently Microsoft release Service Packs which contain a roll up of all previous vendor fixes and patches. However, these patches need to be applied to counter the vulnerabilities and this was not the case for the listed instances, for at least some patches.</Description>
			<LongRecommendation>All systems should have the latest Microsoft security patches applied, particularly when Microsoft issue an emergency patch outside the monthly "patch Tuesday" releases. There are a number of methods for deploying security patches in an enterprise environment, some of which have little to no financial cost implications. However, it is further recommended that an appropriate regression testing mechanism is employed to ensure business continuity and the use of critical business applications.</LongRecommendation>
			<ShortRecommendation>Apply the latest security patches</ShortRecommendation>
